Statistics from the command line!

Staccato is a command line program that lets you compute statistics from
numbers piped in via STDIN. It computes things about the stream of numbers
like min, max, mean, median, and standard deviation. It can also compute
these things about some subset of the stream, for example the lower 95% of
values.

Some examples of how to use Staccato are given below.
